For aesthetic reason, this netlify starter pack has been my favorite theme that I wanted to replicate for my own daily learning blog. But for the last three days I am trying to set up the Netlify CMS backend to avoid the hassle of using Markdown. No matter what I tried, I got a 404. But today at the end of this day, I have finally tied up everything together. I am editing this blog post on a Netlify CMS tool, the site is well backed up in Github.
