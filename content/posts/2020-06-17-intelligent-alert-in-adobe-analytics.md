More often than not, business puts forward a question to you as an Analyst. What is the ROI on our analytics investment? How can you tell me what is going up and what has gone down? Do I need to open for e.g. a pages report every week to analyze any anomalies?

Presenting Intelligent Alerts from Adobe Analytics. Intelligent alerts helps you create alerts that get triggered when a condition gets satisfied. As per the official documentation, Intelligent Alerts let you

* Build alerts based on anomalies (90%, 95%, 99%, 99.75%, and 99.9% thresholds; % change; above/below).
* Preview how often an alert will trigger.
* Send alerts by e-mail or SMS with links to auto-generated Analysis Workspace projects.
* Create "stacked" alerts that capture multiple metrics in a single alert.

Intelligent alert is a part of the Adobe AI fueled system designed to help an Analyst analyze the customer more deeply and perform his job better. To set an Alert, there are two ways:

1. Setting Alert from the Components tab in Adobe Analytics

Alerts are a great way to showcase quick preview of the power of Adobe Analytics. I believe it is also a great way to sustain the interest of Marketing/Business in the power of data as no one can resist opening up an email alert that talks about metrics spike up or spike down.
