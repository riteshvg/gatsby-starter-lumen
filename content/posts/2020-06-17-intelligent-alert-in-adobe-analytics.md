The new Alert Builder and Alert Manager replace the existing alert functionality in Adobe Analytics. Intelligent Alerts let you

* Build alerts based on anomalies (90%, 95%, 99%, 99.75%, and 99.9% thresholds; % change; above/below).
* Preview how often an alert will trigger.
* Send alerts by e-mail or SMS with links to auto-generated Analysis Workspace projects.
* Create "stacked" alerts that capture multiple metrics in a single alert.
