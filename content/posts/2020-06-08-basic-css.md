Today I learned about basic CSS elements via the Free Code Camp's "Responsive Web Design" certification.

There are three ways to add style to a page:

`Through externally linked style sheet;`

`Through inline style in individual tags;`

`Through style tags at the beginning of the page;`

The most preferred option is for the style sheet to reside externally and linking it through the <style> tag in the header.

To change the basic color of text, you can include the color as below

`<h2 style = "color: blue;">Cat</h2>. It is a good practice to end the inline style with a ;`
