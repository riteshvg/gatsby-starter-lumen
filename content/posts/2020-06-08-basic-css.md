Today I learned about basic CSS elements via the Free Code Camp's "Responsive Web Design" certification.

There are three ways to add style to a page:

`Through externally linked style sheet;`

`Through inline style in individual tags;`

`Through style tags at the beginning of the page;`

The most preferred option is for the style sheet to reside externally and linking it with a `style` tag in the header. 

To change the basic color of text, you can include the color as below

`<h2 style = "color: blue;">Cat</h2>. It is a good practice to end the inline style with a ;`

Above is a good way to style, but there's a better way to apply CSS with the usage of `style` tag. Inside that style tag you can create a CSS selector for all h2 elements like this :

```css
<style>
  h2{
    color: red;
  }
</style>
```

Classes are reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements. Example:

```css
<style>
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
   }
</style>

//This can be used as

<h2 class = "blue-text">Cat</h2>
```

A complete style sheet

```css
<link href = "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family="Lobster" 
rel="stylesheet" type = "text/css">

<style>
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
   }

  p{
  font-size: 20px;
  font-family: monospace;
  }

</style>
```
